# Full Stack Web Application with Microservices
### Cryptocurrency Portfolio Manager

### Backend Setup

1. Create all required databases with their respective names (see [database.sql]()).

2. Run each of the services as a regular Maven Spring Boot project: `mvn spring-boot:run`

3. Configuration of these services is outsourced in another repository, so there's no need to configure manually. (see [https://github.com/amnaredo/ironhack-final-project-config](https://github.com/amnaredo/ironhack-final-project-config)).

4. A collection of Postman requests is available to check the details for the REST API (see [collection.json]()).
